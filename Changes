	* 0.52_3 -> after seeing some weird things in the CPAN release, I
	have fixed some documentation bugs. There are probably many more
	to be fixed. This CPAN thing is just plain wonderful, forces you
	to test, document properly, and lots of things...

	* Substituted everything related to XML::Simple; XML parsing is
	now done using  XML::Parser::Tree. Modified some administrative
	files, and run tests. They work. So far.
